**Introduction**

Incendium is a heatmap software designed with the retail environment in mind. Once a connection has been established with the store's POS 
system, generating the heatmap is as easy as scanning the product in a text file and uploading to Incendium.

**Output**

Uploaded aisles are displayed as in the following image:
